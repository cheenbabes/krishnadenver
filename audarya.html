                <p>The Denver Radha Krishna Temple is a branch of ISKCON, (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) which was founded in New York City in 1966 by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, affectionately known as Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada was born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta on September 1, 1896 in a Gaudiya Vaisnava family. In his twenties, he took spiritual initiation from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, who proved to be a very influential figure in Abhaya’s life.</p>


                <p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a leader in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a monotheistic tradition within the broad Hindu culture. He asked Abhaya to take the teachings of Lord Krishna and the Bhagavad Gita to the English-speaking world. When Abhaya became a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, he resolved to carry out that request. Consequently, Abhaya spent the next 32 years preparing for his journey to the Western world.After entering the renounced order of life and accepting the title Bhaktivedanta Swami, Srila Prabhupada reached New York City in 1965 and officially registered the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) on July 11, 1966.</p>

                <p>In the 11 years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe 14 times lecturing and bringing the teachings of Lord Krishna to millions of people. Men and women, boys and girls, young and old from all backgrounds and walks of life took to the practice of Krishna Consciousness. With their help, Srila Prabhupada established ISKCON centers and projects all over the world.Under his inspiration Krishna devotees established dozens of temples, rural communities, educational institutions, and started what would become the world’s largest vegetarian food relief program.Srila Prabhupada returned to India several times, where he sparked a revival of the Vaishnava tradition. In India, he opened many temples, including large centers in the holy towns of Vrindavan and Mayapur.</p>
                <p>Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, perhaps, are his books. He authored over 70 volumes that are highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth, clarity, and fidelity to the tradition. Several of his works are used as textbooks in university courses and have been translated into 76 languages. His most prominent works include: Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the multi-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam and Sri Caitanya-caritamrita.</p>

        <p>Krishna Consciousness, also called Krishna Bhakti Yoga, has been practiced all over the world, but especially in India, since before recorded history. The practice of Krishna Consciousness is based on information found in a body of literature called the Vedas which are among the oldest and most revered wisdom texts on Earth. The Vedas explain that every living entity is a soul characterized by eternality, full bliss and full knowledge, but due to identification with the material body, does not usually experience this. As a result, the soul’s experience is limited to the conditions of the body which include many miseries associated with birth, death, old age and disease. When, however, the soul realizes it’s true spiritual identity, it experiences the characteristics of the soul and goes beyond the influence of all miserable bodily conditions. The process of realizing the soul’s true spiritual identity is called Krishna consciousness or Krishna Bhakti Yoga.</p>
